# Three.js Matrix example

I wanted to recreate the matrix falling code and used what I learned from https://threejs-journey.xyz/ so far to make it.
The effect can be improved a bit and I am still playing around with the animations.


Running Example on my website: http://mark.aronin.ca/matrix/

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
